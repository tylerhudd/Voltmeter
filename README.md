# Voltmeter Program for ATmega328P

This is a simple program for for measuring voltage and displaying the result to an LCD.

## Description
This program was made as an intermediate component to my senior design project.  One part of the project is measuring and displaying voltage levels independent of test equipment and I made this program to make sure I could do that.
